### Broader Impact & Inclusivity Statement

Historically, scientists, engineers, and technological developers have not always considered the future impacts of their discoveries and inventions.  While the utility of the cellphone or the fiber optic cable is not disputed, other inventions such as the automobile have caused harmful external impacts that may have been reduced with careful thought during development.  Additionally, unfair or discriminatory practices are often exacerbated by new technologies, increasing the divide between historically privileged and underprivileged groups.  We kept these ideas in mind when designing our package.

#### Broader Impact

While creating CMAutoDiff, our group debated the consequences of various people using our software.  We present one positive and one negative effect of our package here and both relate to education.  Since the primary purpose of potential flow visualization is for educational purposes, our code is accessible and modifiable.  This allows instructors and students alike to explore different sets of prescribed potential flow problems; both visually and mathematically.  It also allows for forking and further development.  Unfortunately, a malicious actor could take advantage of our code accessibility and modify it to calculate and produce incorrect potential flow results.  In the digital age, it is paramount that developers do everything within their power to guard against disinformation, whether scientific or otherwise.

#### Inclusivity

Since CMAutoDiff is distributed as an educational tool, we designed it with a broad scope of users in mind.  By making it publicly available on GitHub and PyPI, individual users can fork and access our code at will.  We have restricted contributors (due to the scope of the class in which we are enrolled), but any individual wishing to contributed to our library can reach out to the group members via GitHub.  One of the team members will approve collaborators on an individual basis and subsequently approve any pull request with a meaningful contribution to the code base. We have a passion for sharing an interest in fundamentals of fluid mechanics and look forward to other usersâ€™ perspectives and input!
